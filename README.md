## ⚙️ System Architecture  
The project follows a **modular design** with four main components:  
- **I/O Interface**: Handles all user interactions (inputs and outputs).  
- **Main Control Class**: Manages core business logic.  
- **Operation Classes**: Simulate database operations and manage data storage.  
- **Model Classes**: Define templates for users, products, and orders.  

📌 **Key Design Principle**: Only the I/O interface contains `input()` and `print()` functions, ensuring a clear separation of responsibilities.
